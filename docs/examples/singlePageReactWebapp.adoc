= Single page React web-application

Image you already have a React web-application, and you want to serve it from Enonic XP.

Here are the steps to do that:

. Setup a Enonic XP project.
. Depend on lib-static in your build.gradle file.
. Make sure the React application is built and the output is put somewhere under `build/resources/main`.
. Create a webapp controller `src/main/resources/webapp/webapp.ts` that uses lib-static to serve the React application.

== Webapp controller

.src/main/resources/webapp/webapp.ts
[source,typescript]
----
include::../../src/main/resources/webapp/webapp.ts[]
----

== React application

./src/vite/App.tsx
[source,typescript]
----
include::../../src/vite/App.tsx[]
