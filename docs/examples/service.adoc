= Service

This example demonstrates how to serve static assets from a service.

link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/runtime/engines/http-service[Services] are basically available from anywhere in Enonic XP.

In this example we use a service to serve a stylesheet on a dynamically generated page.

Here are the steps needed to do that:
. Depend on lib-static in you build.gradle file.
. Create a service that uses lib-static to serve the stylesheet.
. Create a page controller that generates a page that links to the stylesheet.

== Stylesheet

./src/main/resources/services/myStatic/files/css/style.css
[source,css]
----
include::../../src/main/resources/services/myStatic/files/css/style.css[]
----

== Service

./src/main/resources/services/myStatic/myStatic.ts
[source,typescript]
----
include::../../src/main/resources/services/myStatic/myStatic.ts[]
----

== Page controller

./src/main/resources/site/pages/dynamic/dynamic.ts
[source,typescript]
----
include::../../src/main/resources/site/pages/dynamic/dynamic.ts[]
----
