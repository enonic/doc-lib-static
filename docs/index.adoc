= Static library
:toc: right


== Introduction

Fine grained control over static asset hosting (js, css + html) via your Enonic app. 
Lib-static even supports hosting an entire static webapp.

NOTE: For a more simplistic approach to asset hosting, check out <<https://developer.enonic.com/docs/lib-asset#, lib-asset>> instead.

== Usage

There are many ways of setting up and using lib-static, the gist is:

. Add the library to your app via a dependency
. Use a service, mapping or webapp to serve the assets.
. Place the asset files in your Enonic project's src/main/resources/static/ folder
. Create links to assets from your controller

We have created hands on use cases and examples using <<usage#, services, mappings or webapps>>.
