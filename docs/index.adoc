= Static library
:toc: right


== Introduction

Achieve ultra-high performance with detailed control over edge and client caching for your static assets. Serve files bundled in your Enonic app (i.e. js, css + html) with fine-grained control over cache headers and error handling, suitable even for hosting static webapps and SPAs.

NOTE: For a more simplistic approach to asset hosting, check out <<https://developer.enonic.com/docs/lib-asset, lib-asset>> instead.

== Usage

There are many ways of setting up and using lib-static, the gist is:

. Add a dependency to lib-static
. Place your files in the `/src/main/resources/static/` folder
. Use a <<usage#, service, mapping or webapp>> to deliver the assets.
. Use relative links, or create links to assets from your controllers

We have created hands-on <<usage#, usage examples>> to give you a flying start.
