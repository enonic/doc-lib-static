= spaNotFoundHandler

spaNotFoundHandler is a function that always returns a Response with the `index.html` Resource.

It can be imported and used as a callback for the `notFound` option of the <<api/requestHandler,requestHandler>> function.

Single page applications (SPA) typically consists of some static assets (stylesheets, fonts, images, etc...) and a single entrypoint file (e.g. `index.html`) that is responsible for routing and rendering the application.

Whenever a request doesn't match a static asset, lib-static would by default return a 404 Response.

This is not desireable for a SPA, because the request might be to a client-side routed page, and not a missing static asset.

Such requests can happen when someone reloads or opens a bookmarked url to a client-side routed page.

In addition to routing to client-side "pages", the SPA should render a beautiful 404 page, when no route matches.

See the <<../examples/singlePageReactWebapp#,SPA>> example.
